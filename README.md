# odp2md

This tool extracts relevant data from ODP files and converts it to [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) Markdown targeting conversion to [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer). It was developed to rescue my lecture notes and slide decks, which resided in huge piles of documents made in PowerPoint and LibreOffice. During lectures many times I had to reboot my system just to keep going on with the lecture - this led me think of moving to a method that keeps content and presentation separate.  


# Install

## From Source

```
pip install .
```



## ToDo

- [x] Normalize text output, which needs to remove trailing spaces which are generated by the hierarchy level
- [ ] detect formulas and convert them into proper pandoc Math/inline Math format
- [ ] detect WMF or other obscure formats and use imagemagick or ffmpeg to convert them
- [x] rename media files with a derivative of the slide title
